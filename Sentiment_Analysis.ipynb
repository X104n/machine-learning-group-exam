    "    3.  Handle the data and prepare it such that it fits the models I will be using. This step will contain a couple of subprocess:\n",
    "        a. Tokenizing the data.\n",
    "        b. Sanitizing the data by removing all the stopwords, punctuation and numbers that will only reduce the performance of the Sentiment Analysis model. \n",
    "        c. Lemmatizing the data in order to make it more understandable for the model.\n",
    "        d. Vectorizing in order to fit the data to an graph that I will be using when performing the real Sentiment Analysis. \n",
    "    4. Finding the most optimal algorithm.\n",
    "        a. I will have to try different algorithms with cross validation and use their results in order to find which one fits the data the best. \n",
    "        b. In addition I will need to find the most optimal parameters. I will see later how I choose to search for them. \n",
    "    5. Training the model with the preprocessed data.\n",
    "    6. Testing the model with the preprocessed data. \n",

    "And then I will be evaluating the data, to see if my score is sufficient or not. "
